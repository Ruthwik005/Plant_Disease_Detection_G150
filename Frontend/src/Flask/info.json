In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.",

They thrive in dry, dusty conditions and can cause significant damage. The pests favor excess nitrogen and dry conditions, and their population can explode due to the use of broad-spectrum insecticides. Spider mites can have up to 20 generations per year, and early detection is key for control.",
